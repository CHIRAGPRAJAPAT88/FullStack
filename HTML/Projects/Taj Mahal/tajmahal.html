          The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white
          <a href="" style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">marble mausoleum</a> on the
          right bank of the river

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra" style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Agra</a>, Uttar
          Pradesh, India. It
          was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Mughal
            emperor</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan" style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Shah
            Jahan </a>(r.1628-1658)
          to house the tomb of his beloved wife,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumtaz_Mahal" style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Mumtaz
            Mahal</a>; it also
          houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is
          thecentrepieceof a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a
          mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on
          three sides by a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlement"
            style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">crenellated</a>
          wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work
          continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The
          first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah
          Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of
          Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
          completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to
          be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35
          billion (US$77.8 million).
        </p>
        <p>
          The building complex incorporates the design traditions of
          Indo-Islamic and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_architecture"
            style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Mughal
            architecture</a>. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various
          shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white
          marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for
          other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings
          of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000
          workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led
          by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983
          for being "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the
          universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is
          regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a
          symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist
          attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In
          2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World
          initiative

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The name "Taj Mahal" is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived
          from Arabic and Persian, with the words tāj mahall meaning "crown"
          (tāj) "palace" (mahall).Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636
          Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara
          (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the
          illumined or illustrious tomb.The name "Taj" might have been derived
          from the corruption of the second syllable of "Mumtaz".

                style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Shah Jahan</a> in 1631, to be
              built in the memory of his wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumtaz_Mahal"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Mumtaz Mahal</a>, who died on 17
              June that year while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara
              Begum.Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was
              completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden
              were finished five years later.

          The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of
          Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for
          the Taj Mahal.According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin
          Qazvini, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_Lahori"
            style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;"> Abdul Hamid Lahori</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Saleh_Kamboh" style="text-decoration: none;">Muhammad Saleh
            Kamboh,</a> Shah Jahan
          did not show the same level of affection for others as he had shown
          Mumtaz while she was alive. After her death, he avoided royal
          affairs for a week due to his grief and gave up listening to music
          and lavish dressing for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the
          beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion
          belonging to Raja <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Singh_I"
            style="text-decoration: none;color: blueviolet;">Jai Singh I</a> stood. He chose the place for the
          construction of Mumtaz's tomb after which Jai Singh agreed to donate
          it to the emperor.

              The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of
              Indo-Islamic and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_architecture"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Mughal architecture</a>. Inspirations for the
              building came from Timurid and Mughal buildings including the
              Gur-e Amir in Samarkand (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the
              Mughal dynasty) and Humayun's Tomb in Delhi which inspired the
              Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht plan of the site.The building
              complex employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of
              various shapes and symbols.While the mausoleum is constructed of
              white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was
              used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal
              era buildings of the time.The entire complex sits on platform
              measuring 300 metres (980 ft) in length and 8.7 metres (28.5 ft)
              in height on the banks of Yamuna river. The platform is built
              with varying patterns of dark and light colored sandstone.

                The mausoleum building is the central structure of the entire
                complex. It is a white marble structure standing on a 6-metre
                (20 ft) high square plinth with sides measuring 95.5 metres
                (313 ft) in length. The base structure is a large
                multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an
                eight-sided structure that is approximately 57.3 metres (188
                ft) long on each of the four long sides. The building has four
                identical sides with iwans (arch-shaped doorways), topped by a
                large dome and finial. Each side of the iwan is framed with a
                33-metre (108 ft) high pishtaq (vaulted archway) with two
                similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This
                motif of archways is replicated on a smaller scale on the
                chamfered corner areas, making the design completely
                symmetrical.At the southern side of the platform, facing
                the garden, there are two flights of stairs on either side
                which are partly covered and provide the only access from
                ground level up to the mausoleum building

              The predominant feature of the mausoleum is the 23-metre (75 ft)
              high marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The onion shaped dome
              sits on a 12-metre (39 ft) high cylindrical drum with an inner
              diameter of 18.4 metres (60 ft).The dome is slightly
              asymmetrical and is topped by a 9.6-metre (31 ft) high gilded
              finial.The intermediate zone between the drum and the dome is
              supplanted by a ornamental moulding with a twisted rope design

          The main dome is surrounded by four smaller domes or chattris placed
          at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome.
          The smaller domes are supported by columns which stand on the top of
          the main structure and help bring light to the interior of the
          building. Tall spires called guldastas extend from edges of walls
          which serve as decorative elements. The main and the smaller domes
          are decorated with a design resembling a lotus flower.The domes are
          topped by decorative finials which uses Persian and Indian design
          elements.The main finial was originally made of gold but was
          replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th
          century.The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif,
          whose horns point heavenward

              Four minarets flank the tomb building, one at each corner of the
              plinth facing the chamfered corners. The four minarets, which
              are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, are symmetrically
              arranged on the corners facing the chamfered corners of the main
              building. Each minaret is composed of three almost equal parts
              with balconies at the intersection of the portions. The towers
              are also surmounted by smaller chattris and incorporate the same
              design elements as the main dome with a finial. Steps lead to
              the top of the tower with rectangular openings below the domes
              providing light and air on the top. The minarets were designed
              similar to traditional elements of a mosque, which are used by
              the muezzin to call for prayer. The minarets were constructed
              slightly oriented towards the outside of the plinth so that in
              the event of collapse, the material from the towers would tend
              to fall away from the tomb.

              The external surfaces of the building are decorated with a
              number of delicate relief art adorned with various precious and
              semi-previous stones.The decorative elements were created by
              applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with
              the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic
              forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either
              calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. The white
              marble dados consist of ornamental bas relief depictions of
              nature and plant based elements. The marble has been polished to
              emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings and the frames
              and archway spandrels are decorated with pietra dura inlays of

              The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with
              tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms.
              Herringbone inlays define the space between the adjoining
              elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark
              or black inlays on the white marbles. Contrasting colors have
              been used to create a complex array of different geometric
              patterns across the mortared areas of the buildings. The floors
              and walkways are laid with tiles or blocks with contrasting
              colors and consisting of various tessellation patterns. The
              plinth is differentiated from the paved surface of the main
              platform by a interlocking pattern of octagonal white marble
              pieces set into four pointed stars made of red sandstone,
              surrounded by a border. The building has many lattice windows or

          panels. Higher panels are written with slightly larger script to
          reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below.The calligraphy on
          the southern gate roughly translates to "O Soul, thou art at rest.
          Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you."The
          calligraphy on the buildings were believed to have been created in
          1609 by Abdul Haq, who was conferred the title of "Amanat Khan" by
          Shah Jahan.At the base of the interior dome is the inscription,
          "Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi".

              The main inner chamber is an octagon with 7.3-metre (24 ft)
              sides, with the design allowing for entry from each face with
              the main door facing the garden to the south. Two tiers of eight
              pishtaq arches are located along the walls, similar to the
              exterior.[31] The four central upper arches form balconies or
              viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an
              intricate jali. The inner wall is open along the axes where jali
              screens are fitted which transmit light from the exterior to the
              interior of the main chamber.Except the south side, other three
              sides consist of an open elongated room flanked by two square
              cells covered with decorated ceilings set on the platform. The
              central room has arched openings on three sides fitted with
              jalis filled with panes of glass and a small rectangular window
              cut into the central jali. The square cells which are reached
              through separate doors were probably originally used for
              visitors and Qur'an reciters as a place to rest. Staircases lead
              from the ground floor to the roof level, where there are
              corridors between the central hall and the two corner rooms in
              the south with a system of ventilation shafts.

              The land on which the Taj Mahal is situated was present to the
              south of the walled city of Agra which was given to Shah Jahan
              by Raja Jai Singh I in exchange for a large palace in the centre
              of Agra.The building was commissioned in 1631, and construction
              commenced in 1632. An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was
              excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at
              50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area,
              piles were dug and filled with lime and stone to form the
              footings of the tomb. The platform above the ground was
              constructed of brick and mortar.
            </p>

        <p>
          The tomb complex was built mainly using brick and lime mortar. The
          external surface of the main tomb building and the interior of the
          main cenotaph chamber is veneered with white marble. The other
          interior surfaces and other accessory buildings are lined with red
          sandstone coated with a red octet for protection, excluding the
          exterior surfaces of domes.The white marble came from Makrana in
          Rajasthan, while the red sandstone was quarried from Fatehpur Sikri
          in Uttar Pradesh. Many precious and semi-precious stones, used for
          decoration, were imported from across the world, including jade and
          crystal from China, turquoise from Tibet, Lapis lazuli from
          Afghanistan, sapphire from Sri Lanka and carnelian from Arabia. In
          all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into
          the white marble.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the structure was partially completed, the first ceremony was
          held at the mausoleum by Shah Jahan on 6 February 1643, of the 12th
          anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal.Construction of the
          mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases
          of the project for another five years.The Taj Mahal complex is
          believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost
          estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would
          be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million)

              In December 1652, Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb wrote a letter to
              his father about the tomb, the mosque and the assembly hall of
              the complex developing extensive leaks during the previous rainy
              season.In 1658, Shah Jahan was deposed by Aurangzeb and put
              under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort from where he could
              see the Taj Mahal. Upon Shah Jahan's death in 1666, Aurangzeb
              buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.In the 18th
              century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur attacked the Taj Mahal
              while invading Agra and took away two chandeliers, one of agate
              and another of silver, which had hung over the main cenotaph and
              the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the
              gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at
              the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat
              despoliation.

          By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into
          disrepair. At the end of the century, British viceroy Lord Curzon
          ordered a restoration project, which was completed in 1908.He also
          commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber and replaced the
          gardens with European-style lawns that are still in place today.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building
          in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force.Since
          Indian independence in 1947, the Archaeological Survey of India has
          been responsible for the maintenance of the monument.During the
          India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected
          to mislead bomber pilots
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1983, the Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage
          Site for being "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the
          universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage"
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the late 20th century, the monument has been affected by
          environmental pollution which has turned the Taj Mahal yellow-brown.
          Acid rain and pollution affecting the Yamuna River including the
          presence of Mathura Oil Refinery, have contributed to the same.After
          directives by the Supreme Court of India, in 1997 the Indian
          government set up the "Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)", a
          10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where
          strict emissions standards are in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been
          raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna
          river basin, with cracks appearing in parts of the tomb in 2010 and
          the minarets surrounding the monument showing signs of tilting.Minor
          damage was reported due to storms on 11 April 2018 and 31 May
          2020.In the late 2020s, the Government of India has undertaken
          various restoration measures, including placing mud packs to restore
          the white color and replacing broken marble
        </p>

        <h2>Symbolism</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Due to the global attention that it has received and the millions of
          visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image
          that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol
          of India itself
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a
          symbol of Shah Jahan's wealth and power, and the fact that the
          empire had prospered under his rule.Bilateral symmetry, dominated by
          a central axis, has historically been used by rulers as a symbol of
          a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan
          applied that concept in the making of the Taj Mahal.Additionally,
          the plan is aligned in the cardinal north-south direction and the
          corners have been placed so that when seen from the centre of the
          plan, the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south
          corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively. This makes
          the Taj a symbolic horizon.
