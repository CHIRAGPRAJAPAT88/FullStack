        Born and cultivated in the erstwhile royal courts of Rajasthan, the state is known to be the birthplace of various music and art forms. The site of dancers adorned in colourful attires moving to the melodious sounds of the traditional string instruments perfectly complements the backdrop of the golden sands and the crimson sky of the Thar Desert. Rajasthan is where the ancestral folklore stories of the royals come alive. Rajasthan's rhythm and resonance in its rustic form truly reflects the glory of the state, the religious significance of every incident and upholds the courage and bravery of the Rajputanas.
