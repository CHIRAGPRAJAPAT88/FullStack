        When one speaks of rich culture in India, Rajasthan is what comes to our minds. Proving it true for several
        years now, Rajasthan depicts each nuance of its authentic civilization in its artwork. Stone, clay, leather,
        wool, wood, lac, glass, brass, silver, gold and textiles. You name it and the Rajasthani craft industry has it.
        The industry not only provides mass employment but is also a way of sustaining years of family businesses
        started centuries ago.
