                Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. The past has no power over the present moment. The
                smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything.

            <p>You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. The past has no power over
                the present moment. If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts. The smaller your reality, the
                more convinced you are that you know everything.</p>

                with now, and the most important activity in your life is the one you are involved with now. The smaller
                your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything. This, too, will pass.
